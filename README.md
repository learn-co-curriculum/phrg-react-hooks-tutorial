# React Hooks Tutorial

It is time to take what you have learned about React Hooks and create a mini CRUD React application! Follow these guidelines as you step through the tutorial.

1. Do not copy and paste any of the snippets. It will take longer, but it will help you learn.
1. Investigate functions you do not first understand. Play around with bits of code in your JS console to see how they work.
1. Use `yarn start` to launch your browser and check it often.
1. Use `console.log()` liberally.
1. Make logical commits and push up your changes to a new repo (called `react-hooks`).

Be sure to finish with the full working project because the next lesson in learn will build on top of this application. Send a link of your repository to the instructor. Happy coding!
